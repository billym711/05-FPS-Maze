# Project05 3D Maze

This was our fifth project for MSCH-C220, our first 3D game, where the player has to escape from a maze. Completed on 4/9/2022.

## Added Features

Aside from the basic structure of the game, I created a procedurally generated maze and a functioning mini-map.

## Implementation

## Future Development

More levels, unique levels, and more enemies would all be good. Unfortunately, got pretty frustrated on this project and had to give up on this.
